# Encrypting-and-Decrypting-images
AES is a symmetric key encryption cipher. This means that the same key used to encrypt the data is used to decrypt it.
In this project user is required to select/type their key.After key selection user need to select the image they want to encrypt and click starT,the image will get encrypted and get stored in desired locaton.For image descryption vise versa should be done.

With the right quantum computer AES-128 would take about 2.61*10^12 years to crack  while AES-256 would take 2.29*10^32 years
